Redis Learnings:
. start redis with `redis-cli`
. use `SET <key> "<value>"` to store a key value pair
. use `GET <key>` to retrieve a value based on the key
. use `save` to commit changes to the dump.rdb file in the host filesystem
. dump.rdb is usually located in the `/var/lib/redis/` dir for linux machines,
but this can be checked by using `config get dir`
. dump.rdb can be backed up via cron job or whatever
. for backing up in docker container - mount a local dir to redis dir within the container via the docker-compose file; redis.conf can be set to save data every s seconds, this will write to the file in the mounted directory for persitent storage
